# Estimator

Estimate your tasks more precisely!

## Theory

Regardless of the technique you use, the tendency in project estimation is to provide one number for each estimate. 
In many cases you can be more accurate by applying a simple **PERT** (_Program Evaluation and Review Technique_) model. 
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed 
to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project.

"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. 
It was developed for the U.S. Navy Special Projects Office in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project 
and it found applications all over industry.
